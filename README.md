### Glad to see you here! 
I am a full stack developer who turned his passion for programming into a full-time career.
While I work across the entire stack, my main strength is in the backend, where I focus on building fast, secure, and scalable solutions.

My core technologies are JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, React.js, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
I also have experience with Python (Flask), .NET (C#/VB.NET), Java, SQL Server, and MySQL.

I apply best practices in architecture, testing, and security, including MVC, validation with Zod, JWT authentication with refresh tokens, and CI/CD with GitHub Actions, among other modern development practices.
