### Glad to see you here! 
I'm a full-stack developer who turned his passion for programming into a full-time career. While I work across the entire stack, my main strength lies in the backend, where I focus on creating fast, secure, and scalable solutions.<br/><br/>My core technologies are JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Node.js (Express), and MongoDB. I also have experience with Python (Flask), .NET (C#, VB.NET), SQL Server, and MySQL.<br/><br/>I apply best practices in architecture, testing, and security (MVC, Zod, JWT with refresh tokens), including continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD with GitHub Actions).
